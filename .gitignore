# .gitignore for Data Ingestion and NoSQL Course
# =============================================================================
#
# This .gitignore file tells Git which files and folders
# to ignore when tracking changes in your repository. This is crucial for:
#
# 1. Preventing sensitive data from being accidentally committed
# 2. Avoiding large files that would make the repository heavy
# 3. Keeping the repository clean and focused on code/configuration
#
# HOW TO READ THIS FILE:
# - Lines starting with # are comments (like this one)
# - Each pattern on a line tells Git to ignore matching files/folders
# - Patterns ending with / ignore directories
# - Patterns starting with ! are exceptions (don't ignore these)
# - * is a wildcard that matches any characters
#
